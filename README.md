# RICKLEAPP test

## Instructions

The goal is to create a Rick & Morty characters index in a React website.

To achieve this, you get:

- Design of the web and style/measurements details:
![design](https://github.com/axlalvaro/rickleapp-test/blob/master/rickleapp.png)
![measurements](https://github.com/axlalvaro/rickleapp-test/blob/master/rickleapp_measurements.png)

- A free API ([rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com)) from where to get the characters.
  - https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/

- A base React project with some utils:
  - **Loader** component: this is an iOS-styled spinner or activity indicator. Use it while requesting 
  - **Colors**, **fonts** and a **base css** (/src/css/app.scss). You can write your css code in app.scss.
  - The left bar **rick and morty images**: /src/img/rick.png and /src/img/morty.png.

- **To start working**:
  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Create a new branch with your name to work on.
  3. Use `npm start` and go to http://localhost:8000.

- **When finished**: push your branch to the GitHub repo.

## Tips

- Separate main views into different React Components.

- The more it matches the design, the better, but feel free to take artistic licenses (and provide reason for then if possible).
